The scripts usage
===================

---------------------

Source this file to set up the environment on the machine cpu-b084-pm01:

    . env-cpu-b084-pm01.sh

    
    
env-cpu-b084-pm04.sh
---------------------

Source this file to set up the environment on the machine cpu-b084-pm04:

    . env-cpu-b084-pm04.sh

    
    
cleanup.sh
-----------

Run to remove the EVRMA kernel driver. Will fail if the driver is in use
by any application (the result should be checked by 'lsmod' which shouldn't
list the 'evrma' module).



setup.sh
---------

Loads the EVRMA kernel module.



vevr-evr300.sh
---------------

Brings up a VEVR (/dev/vevr0) with the default maximal configuration for the
EVR300 on the machine cpu-b084-pm04.



vevr-evr230.sh
---------------

Brings up a VEVR (/dev/vevr0) with the default maximal configuration for the
EVR230 on the machine cpu-b084-pm01. Can be used together with 'vevr-evr-slac.sh'.



vevr-evr-slac.sh
-----------------

Brings up a VEVR (/dev/vevr1) with the default maximal configuration for the
SLAC EVR on the machine cpu-b084-pm01. Can be used together with 'vevr-evr230.sh'.



set_2_vevrs_for_evr230.sh
--------------------------

Used to bring up two VEVRs (/dev/vevr0 and /dev/vevr1) on the machine
cpu-b084-pm01, both are made from EVR230. The first VEVR is created by 
vevr-evr230.sh, the second is used for event processing only.


Other scripts
--------------

Other scripts are not meant for manual use. They're designed to support the
automated tests.
