Editing
=========

The following variables should or can be changed to match your system configuration:

- KERNEL_MODULE_EVRMA in Makefile.common at src/ should point
  to the evrmaDriver directory.
  
- INSTALL_LOCATION in Makefile at build-buildroot-2014.08-x86_64 and
  build-rhel6-linux-x86_64 define the path where the installed files will reside.
  
Building
==========

Change dir to build-xxx and type:

	make [target] [INSTALL_LOCATION=path_to_location] [KERNEL_MODULE_EVRMA=path_to_kernel]
	
Note that this enables an alternative way of setting INSTALL_LOCATION and
KERNEL_MODULE_EVRMA.
