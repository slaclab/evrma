Editing
=========

The following variables should or can be changed to match your system configuration:

- KERNEL_MODULE_EVRMA in Makefile.common at src/ should point
  to the evrmaDriver directory.
  
- INSTALL_LOCATION in Makefile at build-buildroot-2014.08-x86_64 and
  build-rhel6-linux-x86_64 define the path where the installed files will reside.
  
Building
==========

Change dir to build-xxx and type (target = all, clean, install, uninstall):

	make [target]
