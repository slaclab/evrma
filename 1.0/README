Editing
=========

The following variables should be changed to match your system configuration:

- KERNEL_MODULE_EVRMA in Makefile.common at src/ should point
  to the evrmaDriver directory.
  
Building
==========

Change dir to build-xxx and type:

	make [target] [INSTALL_LOCATION=path_to_location] [KERNEL_MODULE_EVRMA=path_to_kernel]
	
NOTES:

- The INSTALL_LOCATION defines the path where the installed files will reside.

- Setting KERNEL_MODULE_EVRMA is alternative to hardcoded change in the 
  Makefile.common at src/.
